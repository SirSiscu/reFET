## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed.

### Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Run Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Distribution & Exporting the App

This is a **Single Page Application (SPA)**. It runs entirely in the browser and does not require a backend server.

### 1. Build for Production
To create a standalone version of the app:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a `dist/` folder containing:
- `index.html`
- `assets/` (JS and CSS files)

### 2. How to Share/Host
You can distribute the contents of the `dist/` folder in several ways:
- **Web Server**: Upload the contents of `dist/` to any web host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or a private FTP).
- **Google Sites**: embed the hosted URL as an Iframe.
- **Local Network**: Serve the folder using a simple HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or a dedicated IIS/Apache folder).

**Note on Local File Access**: Due to browser security policies (CORS), simply double-clicking `index.html` from your desktop might not load all scripts correctly. It is best served via a local server or hosted environment.
